Description: Leverages the 'yum' package to
             implement a 'YAML' ('YAML Ain't Markup Language', a human
             friendly standard for data serialization; see <https:yaml.org>)
             standard for documenting justifications, such as for decisions
             taken during the planning, execution and analysis of a study
             or during the development of a behavior change intervention
             as illustrated by Marques & Peters (2019)
             <doi:10.17605/osf.io/ndxha>. These justifications are both
             human- and machine-readable, facilitating efficient extraction
             and organisation.
